  Run mode
    Trace through execution of floodfill, cell-by-cell
    Visualize the call stack with mini-stack-frames

In our think-alouds, we found that experienced subjects seemed to ignore/hide the fact that floodfill is recursive. They looked in the directions in each cell given by the code, and treated it as if it were an iteration-type problem. To emphasize (and to bring intuition to) the recursive nature of floodfill, we are going to make stack-visualization a key feature of this demo.
